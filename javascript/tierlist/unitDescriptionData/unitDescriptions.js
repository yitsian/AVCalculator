When unevo, Delusional boy is a support unit which can work as a replacement for limited supports such as Haruka (although weaker). Smith John has high dps, always doing +40% dmg against enemies he cannot 1 shot. His undercover agent passive gives Smith +5% dmg when attacking the same enemy infinitely stacking. Smith John's assassinate ability will nuke the highest hp enemy in range, which works with his passives making it great for bosses. When Smith's meter is full, he will nuke all enemies in range and Swap to Lord of Shadows.<br><br>Lord of Shadows has amazing aoe on all upgrades, having full aoe on max. when swapping back to smith Shadow will also nuke all enemies in range. Shadow's atomic nuke ability has full map range and is infinitely stacking based upon number of swaps (only counts swaps when atomic gets unlocked) making it great ability for longer modes."

  Sokora: {
    pros: ["Averages out Spa", "Able to use ability on placement"],
    cons: ["Uses lifestocks when corrupting", "Corrupting isn't that useful on low spa units"],
    description: "Sokora is a support unit that pairs well with Saber (Black Tyrant) allowing Salter to have an extra attack building her dark excalibur faster. Sokora’s main gimmick is her ability to average out units SPA. Sokora does this by corrupting units with her ability, consuming lifestocks in the process. Any unit she corrupts, she will take their SPA and average it with her own; corrupted units attack on her SPA instead. This means if you take a high SPA unit and a low SPA unit and corrupt them both, the overall SPA will be lower for the high SPA unit. An example is to corrupt a low SPA unit such as Reimu and a high SPA unit such as Gujo, this process will give Gujo a lower SPA making him attack quicker increasing his dps. "

    description: "Sukono with his familiar becomes a new unit entirely, elevating him to be among the best units in the game. On placement he has good range and full aoe through his follow up along with having a super cheap early full aoe (14k) Sukono applies bleed and cleave (enemies take 20%+ dmg from bleed) making him a great pair with other bleed units. Sukono is curse and buffs curse units by 30% making him good for bosses and a great partner for Koguro. At upg 9 Sukono gains the fire element, burn, and status effect immunity while keeping his full aoe followup applying bleed. Sukono has one of the highest raw dps in the entire game while also being affordable and having a full range nuke. Overall this unit hardly has any weaknesses, any weaknesses this unit does have is overshadowed by his utility and can be made up for by pairing him with other units. "

He will also apply scorched to enemies buffing fire damage by an additional 20%. Tengon has a 60% chance to dodge attacks at max stacks and is guaranteed to crit on enemies that have been debuffed. Since he applies scorched he will always get this buff. His final upg gives him full aoe with a decent SPA and multi-hit. His only real downside is his mediocre range which can be supplemented by units such as The Smith. Overall Tengon is a great unit with high dps and great support.   \r"

While the eclipse is active you can use units such as Newsman, Sukono, Yehowach, The King, etc. to defend. Using the Eclipse again will give you the Falcon of Light who maxxes himself upon arrival. In this form The Falcon buffs allies, slows and repulses enemies, reduces the dmg reduction of enemies while ignoring it on his own and summons demons which give 100 yen on kill, all while having good dps on his own.

Vigil has a wide cone aoe at max and becomes full aoe in Devil Trigger, gaining dmg and rang plus doing 2x dmg due to the doppelganger clone..
